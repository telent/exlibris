Try and keep the privacy model simple ...

Your books are grouped into collections.  You can add friends to each
collection, which allows them to browse/search the books therein.

People who are not your friends post 'requests to borrow': everyone
with the book being searched for (perhaps within a particular
grographical area) is notified when someone asks to borrow it and can
reply or not as they see fit

Reviews are always public, but writers can opt not to have their names
displayed against them.

Borrowing is arranged by conversation between lender and borrower.  If
lender has offered to lend a book, site will check with him a bit later
that the book has been lent, so that it can update book whereabouts

The view which allows adding a book is, in application model terms,
creating a Book and creating or finding an Edition and/or Publication.
